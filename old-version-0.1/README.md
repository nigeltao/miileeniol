This directory contains an earlier, unsuccessful experiment.

There were only 32 letters: 10 base consonants and 6 base vowels. Every base
letter could optionally have an overline diacritic: "G" is a modified "K", "D"
is a modified "T", etc.

It was cute in an algorithmic way (computer programmers do like the numbers 10,
16 and 2), but I found it slow to read, and I invented it. I think it's a
failure, although these images are kept in the repository as some might find it
an interesting failure.

Later versions of the alphabet have 36 letters. The 12 vowels keep the 6 times
2 concept, but the 24 (up from 20) consonants each have a unique letter.
